# AWS Lambda with S3 and DynamoDB 
This project outlines a serverless media upload hub built using AWS Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB. It enables users to upload media files through a web interface, storing the files in S3 and their associated metadata in DynamoDB.

## Features
* **Serverless Backend** : Utilizes AWS Lambda for efficient and scalable processing without managing servers.
* **Object Storage**: Employs Amazon S3 for durable and highly available storage of media assets.
* **Data Management** : Uses Amazon DynamoDB for flexible and fast storage of media metadata.
* **User-Friendly Interface** : Provides a simple web form for media uploads.

## Workflow Summary
1. **User Uploads a File** → Through an API endpoint.
2. **API Gateway** → Routes request securely to AWS Lambda.
3. **Lambda Function** → Validates, processes, and uploads file to Amazon S3.
4. **DynamoDB** → Stores metadata like file name, timestamp, and user details.
5. **Lambda** → **API Gateway** → **User** → Returns a success response with a download link.

## Project Walkthrough and Components

Here are the key aspects of the project, illustrated with screenshots:

---
### 1. Upload Interface
---

This image shows the web form used for uploading media, where users input a name, caption, and select a file.

---
### 2. IAM Role Permissions
---
The IAM Role ensures that the AWS Lambda function securely interacts with S3 and DynamoDB without exposing credentials.

🚀 **Step-by-Step Setup Guide**

1. **Open AWS Console** → Navigate to IAM Service.
2. **Click Roles** → Create Role.
3. **Choose Trusted Entity** :
    * AWS Service → Select Lambda.
4. **Attach Managed Policies**:
    * `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` (for logging)
    * `AmazonS3FullAccess` (for S3 bucket operations)
    * `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` (for DynamoDB access)
5. **Review and Create Role**.
6. Assign this role to your **Lambda function** under its configuration settings.

 ### 5. S3 Bucket Overview
 ---
 The S3 bucket will be used for secure file storage, enabling temporary access links with expiration policies to ensure data privacy and controlled sharing.

🚀 **Step-by-Step Setup Guide**

1. **Open AWS Console** → Navigate to S3 Service.
2. **Click “Create Bucket”.**
3. **Enter the Bucket Name**:
    * `majisimpleb`
4. **Select Region**:
    * `ap-south-1 (Asia Pacific - Mumbai)`
5. **Uncheck "Block All Public Access"** (*if using pre-signed URLs*).
6. **Enable Bucket Versioning** (*recommended for file recovery*).
7. Click **Create Bucket** to finalize.
8. Configure **Bucket Policies** and **IAM Roles** to restrict access.

### 6. DynamoDB Table Entries
---
The DynamoDB table is designed to store file metadata, allowing secure tracking of files, managing expiration policies, and generating download statistics.  
It is serverless, highly scalable, and automatically adapts to incoming traffic.

🚀 **Step-by-Step Setup Guide**

1. **Open AWS Console** → Navigate to DynamoDB Service.
2. Click **Create Table**.
3. Configure basic settings:
   * **Table Name** : `lambda`
   * **Partition Key** : `id (String)`
4. Under **Capacity Mode**, select **On-Demand**.
5. Enable **Encryption** using **AWS Managed Key (KMS)**.
6. (Optional) Turn on **Point-in-Time Recovery** for backups.
7. Click **Create Table** to finalize.
